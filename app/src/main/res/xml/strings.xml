        "Poverty is the state of having few material possessions or little income. Poverty can have "
        "diverse social, economic, and political causes and effects. When evaluating poverty in statistics "
        "or economics there are two main measures: absolute poverty compares income against the amount needed "
        "to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter; relative poverty measures when "
        "a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place."
        "The definition of relative poverty varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.\n\n"

        "Statistically, as of 2019, most of the world's population lives in poverty: in PPP dollars, "
        "85% of people live on less than $30 per day, two-thirds live on less than $10 per day, and "
        "10% live on less than $1.90 per day (extreme poverty). According to the World Bank Group in 2020, "
        "more than 40% of the poor live in conflict-affected countries.Even when countries experience "
        "economic development, the poorest citizens of middle-income countries frequently do not gain an "
        "adequate share of their countries' increased wealth to leave poverty. " \n\n

        "Governments and non-governmental organizations have experimented with a number of different policies"
        "and programs for poverty alleviation, such as electrification in rural areas or housing first policies"
        "in urban areas. The international policy frameworks for poverty alleviation, established by the United"
        "Nations in 2015, are summarized in Sustainable Development Goal 1: "No Poverty"." \n\n
